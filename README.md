# 🏓 VR Wheelchair Ping Pong

**VR Wheelchair Ping Pong** is an accessibility-focused VR ping pong game created for wheelchair users.  
Built in **Unity (2022.3.31f1)** with **SteamVR/Oculus** support, the project emphasizes **realistic physics**, **adaptive AI opponents**, and **sub-10 ms motion tracking** for smooth, immersive gameplay.  

This repository combines all documentation, images, and the full Unity source code for the 2024-2025 senior design project.
